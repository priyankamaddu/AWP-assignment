    <h2 style="color:goldenrod;">About CSE</h2>
    <p>The full form of CSE is Computer Science Engineering. 
        It is an engineering course that involves several computer science 
        aspects essential for the creation of the computer system.
         It is a four-year undergraduate engineering course wherein students study 
         computer software & hardware for theoretical & practical knowledge.
        The CSE course covers computational-related subjects such as programming languages, algorithm analysis, 
        software, device hardware & programme design. Computer science was previously 
        considered as part of the departments of mathematics or engineering, 
        but now it has become a different field of engineering.
        The undergraduate and postgraduate CSE courses available and the applicant must satisfy a few requirements to be admitted to the CSE course mentioned below.
       CSE is eligible for applicants who have passed a 10th and 12th examination from a 
       recognised education board with Chemistry, Physics & Mathematics as primary subjects 
       and the appropriate passing percentage.Applicants who have achieved a minimum 
       passing percentage in B.Tech from a recognised college or university are qualified 
       for CSE.
