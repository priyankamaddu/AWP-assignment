    <h3 style="color:yellow;">Usage of Inline CSS</h3>
    <p style="color:crimson;">An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</p>
    <p style="color:green;">An inline CSS uses the "style" attribute of an  HTML element.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(243, 8, 47);">Usually, CSS is written in a separate CSS file (with file extension .css) 
        or in a "style" tag inside of the "head" tag, but there is a third place 
        which is also valid. The third place you can write CSS is inside of an HTML tag, 
        using the style attribute. When CSS is written using the style attribute, 
        its called an “inline style”. In general, this is not considered a best practice. 
        However, there are times when inline styles are the right (or only) choice. 
        The style attribute is just like any other HTML attribute. 
        It goes inside the elements beginning tag, right after the tag name. 
        The attribute starts with style, followed by an equals sign, =, and then 
        finally uses double quotes, "", which contain the value of the attribute.
        In our case, the value of the style attribute will be CSS property-value pairs: 
        "property: value;". You can have as many property value pairs as you want. 
        Unlike normal CSS syntax, inline styling does not use selectors or curly braces. 
        Don't forget to include the semicolon ; after each pair!
        Inline styles are not so different from the other ways you can write CSS. 
        For example, the inline style above is almost like the following CSS rule:

    </p>
    
</body>
